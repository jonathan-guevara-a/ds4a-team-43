Before running the application, please create a file named **secure/database.txt** with the following structure:

. host
. database name
. database user
. database password

The first 4 lines of the file should contain the previous information, without any label or parameter name, since
these values will be used as follows:

[source, python]
----
postgresql://{DB_USERNAME}:{DB_PASSWORD}@{DB_HOST}/{DB_NAME}
----
